<center> <h1>Lógica da <br> Programação</h1> </center>


<center> <h2>  Welcome to The European Conference on Arts, Design & Education <br> 
(ECADE2022), which IAFOR is hosting in the historic city of Porto, <br> 
Portugal, and in partnership with the University of Porto, the <br>
ID+/Research Institute for Design, Media and Culture, and the <br> <b>IAFOR Research Centre OSIPP, Osaka University, Japan.</b>
 <br>
Strategically nestled on a beautiful stretch of the Iberian peninsula, <br>
and with over 2,000 years of history, Porto enjoys spectacular <br>
architecture, from the ancient to the modern, and the entire historic <br>
centre of the city, with its spectacular waterfront, is listed as a <br>
World Heritage Site. It is a renowned centre for great cuisine, and <br>
its world famous Port wine. This cultural, architectural and <br>
gastronomic centre will be an excellent venue for our conference </h2> </center>
              

<h3 > TASK<span>#01</span> </h3>   

<h4> ECADE2022 will explore and share how art, design and education together can have an <br> 
impact, make a societal difference, and contribute to the economy and how we think, live, <br>
work, and learn. As we emerge from the pandemic, and face climate emergency, this is a <br>
unique opportunity to review our values, and thus renew our sense of citizenship, and what<br>
constitutes the ‘common good’ both locally and globally. </h4>             
  
<h3> TASK<span>#02</span></h3> 
<h4> Our conference will look at how design shapes and mediates ideas, how the visual arts <br> 
challenge and question our perceptions, and <span>how education seeks ways to develop our <br>
shared understanding and our skills</span> to listen, and to find different ways to speak and to act <br>
together. </h4>
